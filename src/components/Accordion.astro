				<strong>This is the second item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by
				default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use
				to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well
				as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this
				with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting
				that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>,
				though the transition does limit overflow.
